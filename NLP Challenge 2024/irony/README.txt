This corpus was collected from Twitter and annotated as they contain or not contain irony, thus representing a dataset for binary classification.
Proposed task is a binary classification task, where the goal is to predict whether a tweet is ironic (labeled as 1) or not (labeled as 0).
Both a labeled training and validation set are provided, while for the test set only the textual information are released.
The evaluation metric is the F1 score.
