This corpus was collected from Twitter and annotated with reference to the emotion polarity of the dataset.
In particular, here is proposed a more nuanced classification task, based on 4 labeled emotions, namely anger (0), joy (1), optimism (2) and sadness (3).
Proposed task is a multi-class classification task, where the goal is to predict the emotion in a given message.
Both a labeled training and validation set are provided, while for the test set only the textual information are released.
The evaluation metric is the macro average F1 score.
